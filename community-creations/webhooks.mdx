Here's how to create a new webhook in Supernotes using the Supernotes API.

## Features

* Creates a new webhook in Supernotes
* Requires API key for authentication
* Defines the webhook URL

## Parameters

* `ENTER_API_KEY_HERE`: Replace with your Supernotes API key
* `ENTER_URL_HERE`: Replace with the URL for the webhook

## Request

* Method: `POST`
* URL: `https://api.supernotes.app/v1/user/webhooks/`
* Headers:
	+ `accept: application/json`
	+ `Api-Key: ENTER_API_KEY_HERE`
	+ `Content-Type: application/json`
* Body: `{"url": "ENTER_URL_HERE"}`

## Example CURL command

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.supernotes.app/v1/user/webhooks/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: ENTER_API_KEY_HERE' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "url": "ENTER_URL_HERE"
}'
```


<Note>
  Remember to remove the webhook when you’re done to avoid sending your cards to
  places you don’t intend. Once you actually have a use-case / place you want to
  send your cards consistently it is of course fine to leave that webhook in
  place indefinitely.
