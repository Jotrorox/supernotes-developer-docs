</Info>

I like the embed feature in Supernotes for YouTube videos. I created a shortcut that grabs the url and the title of a YouTube video and uses that information to make a new card with the video embedded.

Essentially I use the Get url shortcut method to grab the title for the video I’m sharing from YouTube and save it a variable named “title”.

I then get the url from the same method and stick that in a text method to creat the markdown necessary for embedding a YouTube video in a card.
@[youtube](link to video)
This markdown text is saved in a variable named “link”.

Then using the link https://api.supernotes.app/v1/cards/simple in a new get url method set to post along with my API key in the header and my variables in the body along with some tags I use, the necessay info is sent to my account and creates a new card that is titled after the YouTube video with the video embedded in the card.

I then use the open app method to open SuperNotes and my card should be the newest created.
