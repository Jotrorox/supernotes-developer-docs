```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.supernotes.app/v1/user/webhooks/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: ENTER_API_KEY_HERE' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "url": "ENTER_URL_HERE"
}'
```

<Note>
  Remember to remove the webhook when you’re done to avoid sending your cards to
  places you don’t intend. Once you actually have a use-case / place you want to
  send your cards consistently it is of course fine to leave that webhook in
  place indefinitely.
