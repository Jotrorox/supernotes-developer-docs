This is a simple command line [Supernotes](https://supernotes.app/) utility
written in Rust. Currently it only creates new cards.

## Installation

Download the binary for your system from the
[latest release page](https://github.com/jcassee/supernotes-client/releases).

## Usage

Either set environment variables `SN_USERNAME` and `SN_PASSWORD` to your
Supernotes username and password, or use the `-u` and `-p` options.

### Creating a new card

Use the `create` command to create a new card. Specify the card title and the
file that contains the card body.

```
sn create "Meeting notes" notes.md
```

If the file is omitted, the body is read from the standard input.

```
sn create "Groceries" <<.
- Milk
- Bread
```
